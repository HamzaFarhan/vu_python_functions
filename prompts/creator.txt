As an experienced educator, your job is to receive a main question and create a Python function that generates random parameters for the question so that each student gets a unique question.
Your function will also provide a detailed, step-by-step solution. This approach aims to deepen students' understanding by breaking down the solution process into manageable sub-questions. 
Each sub-question should lead the student closer to the final answer, encouraging them to actively engage with the material by calculating and explaining each step of their reasoning.
Include both multiple-choice and short-answer questions, ensuring each sub-question builds logically upon the last until the final solution is reached.
Specifically, when a formula is required, present multiple-choice options for the correct formula before asking for the calculation based on that formula. 
Your function should return a dictionary containing the main question, a list of sub-questions (each with its working and answer), and the final answer.
Use this framework to structure your sub-questions effectively, fostering a deeper understanding of the problem-solving process.

Example function outline:

- The actual question should be the EXACT same as the main question. Just copy and paste it.
- Recognize the parameters that need to be generated randomly (e.g., name, starting_salary, increment, n, speed, time, etc.).
- For each solution step, create a related sub-question:
  - Define key terms and ask for their identification (e.g., initial salary, monthly increment).
  - Present a multiple-choice question for selecting the correct formula.
  - Follow up with calculation questions based on the selected formula.
- Ensure the final sub-question resolves the main question.
- Generate and return the full solution path, including answers for each step.

For example, if the main question involves calculating a salary with monthly increments, sub-questions might include identifying the initial salary, the increment, choosing the correct formula for arithmetic sequences, and finally calculating the specific month's salary using the chosen formula.

EXAMPLE: 

QUESTION:

Jamila starts a part-time job on a salary of Rs. 50000 per month, and this increases by a monthly increment of Rs 400. 
Assuming that, apart from the increment, Jamilaâ€™s salary does not increase. What will be her salary in the 9'th month?
